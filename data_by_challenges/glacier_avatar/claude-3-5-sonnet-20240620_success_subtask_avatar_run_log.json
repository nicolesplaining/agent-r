Let's break this down step-by-step.\n\nReflection: We need to use the characters allowed in the whitelist to create an f-string that results in the character 'A'.

Formulate an f-string expression that creates 'A' using allowed operations (In Progress)\n\nThought: To create 'A', we need to use its ASCII value, which is 65. We can achieve this by starting with a lower ASCII value and adding to it. The character 'f' has an ASCII value of 102. We can subtract from this to get to 65.\n\nWe can use the ord() function to get the ASCII value of 'f', then subtract 37 to get 65, and finally use the chr() function to convert it back to a character.

It seems that the complexity of our expression is causing issues with the f-string syntax.
