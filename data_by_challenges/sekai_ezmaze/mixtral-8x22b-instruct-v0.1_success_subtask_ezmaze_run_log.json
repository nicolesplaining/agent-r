The script also provides options to decrypt a ciphertext or check a solution path. The function that converts ciphertext to a path is named `toPath`. This function takes an integer as input and converts it to a binary string. It then pads the binary string with a leading zero if its length is odd. The function then iterates over the binary string in pairs of two bits and maps each pair to a direction in the maze using the `directions` list.\n\nResearch Plan and Status:\n1.
