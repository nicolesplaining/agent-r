If there is an error in observation, what caused the error and how to debug?\nLog: A enumerated list of the exact commands that you have run before so you won't rerun the same commands plus a short and concise summary of the conclusion that you reached from running that command. You have to copy and paste the exact enumerated list from your previous response and append the command from last iteration to the list.

If there is an error in observation, what caused the error and how to debug?\nLog: A enumerated list of the exact commands that you have run before so you won't rerun the same commands plus a short and concise summary of the conclusion that you reached from running that command.
